AMEND Consulting Case Competition
=================================

Hosted by the [Big Data and Analytics Association][BDAA]

Problem Statement
-----------------

AMEND Consulting has hired BDAA as subcontractors to help analyze data for a manufacturing
client, Metal Working Group (MWG).
MWG runs a job shop specializing in various metal fabrication applications.
They have given us over 5 years of financial transaction data representing every single job
completed.
It is our job to find the important insights in the data and then **recommend the best actions
to maximize profit for the business**.


Guiding Questions
-----------------

This analysis is intended to open-ended and creative, however, here are some key areas to look
at:

- Trend Analysis – Looking for Increase / Decrease / Variability in:
  - Profit / Revenue / Cost
  - of Customers
  - of Jobs Shipped
  - of Parts per Shipment
- 80 / 20 Pareto Analysis:
  - Which customers create the most revenue / cost?
  - Which parts drive the most revenue  / cost?
- Forecasts
- **MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DECISIONS**
  - Finance / Sales
  - Operations

Final Deliverable
-----------------

The final deliverable is a PowerPoint Presentation detailing the key insights found and
recommendations for action.
Presentation time is limited to **10 minutes** with an additional 5 minutes for questions.
Please feel free to include additional analysis in the Appendix.
